# Surfs_Up

##### Overview

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

##### Results

-The average temperature for June is 74.9 degrees, while the average temperature for December is 71.0 degrees. This is a 3.9 degree difference, meaning June is a warmer month on average.

-The minimum temperature for June is 64.0 degrees, while the minimum temperature for December is 56.0 degrees. June has a higher floor for cold temperatures, staying quite temperate all day long, while in December there are some cooler temperatures during certain days and parts of the day.

-The maximum temperature for June is 85.0 degrees, while the maximum temperature for December is 83.0 degrees. The maximum temperature is a two degree difference, with June being warmer.

-The standard deviation for June is 3.26, while it is 3.75 in December, a .49 difference.

-The difference in maximum to minimum temperature for December is 27 degrees (83 to 56), and is 21 for June (85 to 64).

##### Summary

With a higher standard deviation (3.75 to 3.26) and wider span of temperatures for December (56 to 83 degrees, a total of 27, compared to June's 21 degree span 64 to 85), the results indicate there is a greater range and variation of temperatures in December. This can be seen in the difference of the minimum, 25, 50, 75, and maximum temperatures. However, there is only a four degree separation between the 25 percentile and 75 percentile for June, ranging from 73-77 degrees, while for December there is a five degree separation from 69 to 74 degrees. Both these are fairly temperate and indicate that in general, there is warmth and pleasant temperatures in both months. The overall warmth of both months, but especially December when it is generally colder, demonstrates that people would most likely continue surfing and consuming ice cream.

However, more analysis should be completed. The precipitation data from the modules should be included in any discussion and consideration of opening up a surf and ice cream shop because a significantly rainy month or two could provide some difficulty to turn a profit in those months. Other studies and analysis that should be collected and analyzed include: wind, cloudiness, and wave size. Cloudiness is needed because if there are months with significant overcast, temperatures could chill a bit or some people might not be as likely to go to a beach because the weather is not as nice, meaning they might not surf or consume ice cream. Wind and wave size are needed to determine if the wind would cause any problems with surfers engaging in the sport, a windy day or month could cause problems for surfers. And wave analysis is needed to make sure there are waves, and large enough ones, for surfers to enjoy their sport.
